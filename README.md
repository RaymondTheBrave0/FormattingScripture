These collection of scripts process Word documents to standardize Bible references to the format currently this format "Book Chapter:Verse" (e.g., "John 3:16"). With the view to in the future the user being able to
choose either a long, short or medium bible scripture reference format. There is also a plan to be able to process PDF's and other formats as input in the future.
It handles various abbreviations, creates backups before making changes, and includes proper error handling.Verse ranges use hyphens (e.g., "John 3:16-18") and multiple verses use commas (e.g., "John 3:16,18").
It will keep any brackets or parenthases and other characeteristics like an "*" after a reference for a note for example.
It will handle multiple scriptures on one line and spread over one line.
This is my first project programming in Python and using Git and Github.
